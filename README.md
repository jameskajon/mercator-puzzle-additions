# mercator-puzzle-additions

****
I DID NOT MAKE THIS, Bramus! (github.com/bramus) DID BASED ON THE ORRIGINAL BY GOOGLE
****

took https://github.com/bramus/mercator-puzzle-redux and made additions to make it more competative

changes:
• changed countires to place from 15 to 177
• added count of countires that the user gave up on finding by double clicking
• added 'end game' button to place all remaing countries
• added timer that can be stopped and stated by the user, but will start each time a country is placed and stop once all are placed
